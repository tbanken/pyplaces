################################
.. note::
   pyplaces is still in development, so if you run into any bugs please report them `here <https://github.com/tbanken/pyplaces/issues/>`_.

**Pyplaces** is a Python package that allows you to easily read places data from a known address, place, or just a bounding box. Currently, the two sources are
Overture Maps and Foursquare Open Places. Overture Maps provides support to get data from multiple versions of the dataset for all of its themes. 
Foursquare Open Places is primarily point of interest data which is also supports fetching multiple versions of the dataset.

**The available datasets are: Foursquare Places and Categories, Overture Places, Addresses, Transportation, Buildings, and Base layers.**

Quickstart
**********

Installation
============

This package is available on PyPI as well as conda-forge: ::

   pip install pyplaces

I recommend that you use Anaconda for your Python environments. (I use miniforge and mamba)::

   conda install pyplaces

Basic Usage
===========

To access any places, all you need is a place, address, or bounding box: ::

   from pyplaces.foursquare_open_places import foursquare_places_from_address

   hemenway_st_places = foursquare_places_from_address("204 Hemenway Street, Boston, MA")

Additionally, you can:

* :ref:`Select and filter on columns using the \(column,operator,value\) syntax <filters>`
* :ref:`Get data from past releases <versions>`
* :ref:`Inspect dataset schemas <schemas>`
* :ref:`Find relevant category names for retrieving places data <categories>`

Examples
========

.. nbgallery::
   notebooks/example1
   notebooks/example2
   notebooks/example3
   notebooks/example4
   
Most, if not all, of the functions follow the same type of workflow.

User Reference
**************

The user reference is available :ref:`here <user-ref>` in case you run into any issues.

pyplaces Usage
**************

This package uses a geocoder that uses OpenStreetMaps's geocoding service Nominatim. Please abide by their usage policy `here <https://operations.osmfoundation.org/policies/nominatim/>`_.

Future Support
**************

* more readable schema output
* more filter operators
* reduce time in the pyarrow parquet reading pipeline
* speed up model transactions- current implementation is inefficient
* support more geoparquet datasets
* basic network analysis for transportation data
